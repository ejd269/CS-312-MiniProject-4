This is Mini-Project 4 for CS312.

For this assignment, I took the old express server that used EJS tags and adapted it over to a React framework. For functionality with grabbing posts, I took the original blog post site and continued to use it as a backend server for the new React components.

I apologize in advance, some components were not fully finished by the time of submission. I did the most that I could, as it took a while for me to understand React and all the things that were needed for this assignment.

To view the assignment as intended, download the files involved in the second commit that are marked as "files for backend". Use "node index.js" and start the server on port 3001 to initiate the backend. From there, download the first commit "main files" and use "npm run dev" to run the front end on port 5173 with all of the React stuff. Everything should be able to work as it did in the video. I was able to do this myself by following the Local Development Setup tutorial in our Canvas course and replacing all the necessary files with the ones from GitHub.

If there are any problems with loading/viewing these files, please let me know. 

Thanks,
Eric
